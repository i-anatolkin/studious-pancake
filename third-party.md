## Python Decouple: Strict separation of settings from code

Decouple helps you to organize your settings so that you can change parameters without having to redeploy your app.

It also makes it easy for you to:

- store parameters in ini or .env files;
- define comprehensive default values;
- properly convert values to the correct data type;
- have only one configuration module to rule all your instances.

It was originally designed for Django, but became an independent generic tool for separating settings from code.
